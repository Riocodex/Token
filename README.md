## STEPS IN TOKEN DESIGN
- initial supply: the amount of tokens sent to a user
- capped/max supply: the amount of tokens to exist in the contract
- minting strategy: what and what happens before awarding a token
- block reward: rewarding user tokens
- burnable: destroying tokens..also a good way to create value of the token in the market
